# Store-data-in-MongoDB-in-R-and-Python
# Code in R to store data to MongoDB:
 I. First, we need to load the data which we want to store in MongoDB.
 II. Then we need to use the function insert. It’s syntax: insert(data, pagesize = 1000, stop_on_error = TRUE, ...) III. We will store 2 types of Data: a Dataframe and a character vector with JSON strings which means document in the form of JSON.
